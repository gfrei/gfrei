# Hi, I'm Guilherme! VR Unity programmer
## üë®‚Äçüíª Software Development in studios:

### Slink & Snatch
#### Project Description: VR Stealth Game
- 2-3 years project
- Team from 2 to 5
- Meta Quest 2 as target device

#### Feature highlights:
- **Implemented asset streaming to enable a full city to run at 90 fps on Meta Quest 2**. This is achieved dividing the city in many sections, and using a neighbour loader strategy. It was also needed to use portals to define when the Player was moving between sections, as each area had complex interconnections, and could be inside one another.
- **Implemented Enemy AI using FSM.** States including Patrol, Investigate, Chase, Shooting. I had to implement senses to trigger the enemy's alertness, such as Sight, Hearing and Touch.
